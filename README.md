# Professional README Generator

## Motivation for Project

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions—this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.

Having a README Generator will allow the developer to save time writing the document. The README Generator will also make sure important information isn't missing from the file, and make sure the information is displayed in an accessable, logical way, so that other developers spend less time in confusion when trying to maintain a project.

I am personally building this project because I suck at writing README files, and I find it boring; I want to be spending my time writing code and not drafting explanations, etc. However, as a developer, I want to be easy to collaborate with so that people don't hate working with me.

## Installation and Use

##Ideas for Future Development

1. There is no validate function in the questions array to require the user to provide input.
2. Sometimes it is helpful to have pictures in the README. I would like to add a prompt asking the user for file paths for images they might want to include, prompt for a title, and then have that appear in the generated README.
